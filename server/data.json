The key features of a market economy include private ownership of resources, the existence of competitive markets, and the role of prices and profit incentives in allocating resources. This differs from a planned economy, which is an economic system in which the government controls the allocation of resources through central planning. In a planned economy, resources are typically owned and controlled by the government and production is directed towards fulfilling centrally planned targets and objectives.",
